# Automated Testing Projects with Selenium and API Integration 💻

This repository hosts a series of automated testing projects that use Selenium for UI testing and API Integration for web service testing. Each project focuses on different scenarios and applications.

## Overview 🔧

In these projects, we utilize the following technologies and approaches:

- **Selenium WebDriver**: For automating tests on web applications, interacting with UI elements, and automating workflows.
- **API Integration**: For testing web services, validating responses, and ensuring the proper functionality of APIs.
- **Test Configuration**: We use flexible configurations for test data and environment settings to adapt to various scenarios.
- **Test Automation**: We implement automated test cases that can be repeatedly executed to ensure software quality.
- **Dependency Management**: We use dependency management tools like Maven to handle necessary libraries and resources for testing.
- **Project Documentation**: Each project includes a detailed description of test cases, configurations, and steps to run the tests.
